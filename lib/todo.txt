Solve the problems as they arise.

1. I want to get a list of images from unsplash.
    Done!
2. I want to transform the data that I get into a list of images that I can add to the existing list of images
    Done!
3. I want to add 'author' prefix to images on the main list and description inside.
    Later in polishing stage
4. I want to add infinite pagination. When we reach the end of the screen we load the next 'page'.
    Done!

Main functionality is complete. Now I want to polish this app.

1. I want a progress indicator whenever I fetch something.
2. I want a 3rd issue in previous block to be completed.


Persistance with LocalStorage:

1. Create a favoriteIdList property on store. It will hold ids of the favorited items.
    done 
2. When we toggleFavorite we add id to the list of liked items. If it's already there we remove it. 
    done 1/2
3. The isFavorite property will be deprecated. I will check if the id is in the favoriteIdList with indexWhere and 'str' == 'str' to determine if the heart should be filled.
